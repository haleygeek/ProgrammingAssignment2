This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

power <- function(exponent) {
  function(x) x ^ exponent
}

square <- power (2)
print(class(square))
square(2)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
```{r}
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        solved <- NULL
        setSolved <- function (y){
              unsolved <<- y
              solved <<- NULL
        }
        getInverted <- function () solved
         
        
}

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inverted <- x$getInverted()
        
        if(!is.null(solved)) {
                message ("getting cached data")
                return(solved)
        }
        
        unsolved <- x$get()
        solved <- solve(unsolved, ...)
        x$setSolved(solved)
        solved
}
```
