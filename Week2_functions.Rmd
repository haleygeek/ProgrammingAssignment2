This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Define a function like a variable
add2 <- function (x,y) { 
  x+ y  
   }

```

```{r}
#Returns subset of #s greater than 10
above10 <- function (x){
  use<- x > 10
  x[use]
}
```

```{r}
#Dataframe with average of each column
columnmean <- function (y, removeNA){
  nc <- ncol (y)
  means <- numeric(nc)
  for(i in 1:nc){
    means[i] <- mean(y[,i], na.rm = removeNA )
  }
  means
}
```

```{r}
#Lexical scoping demo - fn within a fn
make.power <- function (n){
  pow <-function (x) {  #function x has access to var n because pow is a member of make.power's environment
    x^n
  }
}

cube <- make.power(3)
square <- make.power(2)
cube(3)
square(3)

```
```{r}
